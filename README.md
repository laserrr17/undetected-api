# undetected-api

This project provides a simple and user-friendly graphical interface for submitting text to the Undetectable.AI service, which processes and returns "humanized" versions of the input content. It is designed for users who require automated content humanization, such as writers, marketers, or educators who want to refine their text to seem more natural and human-like.

The GUI allows for easy input of text and displays the humanized output after processing. It is particularly beneficial for individuals who are not comfortable with command-line tools or programming environments, enabling them to access advanced text humanization technology with minimal technical knowledge.
